Tank game includes 2 scripts which can be run:

- main.py
- map_maker.py

main.py is the main game.
map_maker.py is for making the maps for the game. The map maker is not idiot proff.
Make sure to create polygons in a clockwise pattern else the collision won't work properly.
Make sure to not make a polygon with less than 3 corners or else it crashes.
Make sure to place the player tank first before any of the enemy tanks are placed.
To quickly test map, save it without any name in namebox or call it "map_test1" 
and then run main.py -> settings -> quick play
