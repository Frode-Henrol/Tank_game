add:
+   Make alternativ control for tanks - toggle in menu?
+   Update colors of original tanks - should be more distinct, less pale
+   Add team select in map_maker and fix bug: 2 poly crash, clockwise only poly generation

Fix:
- white hue control screen

Major features
-   simpel multiplayer
-   Reinforcement Learnt ai
-   Determin to use accumalter for physics and cap at 60 fps? that mean removing accumatlor in tankAI also


Multplayer:

Host:
-   Send data each frame of all tank postions, rotation, projectile postions/dir + obstacles destroyed

Client:
-   Only send own tank pos, rotation, and projectile list pos, dir


AI needs to be updated so it targerted unit is not hard coded as player_controlled[0], but instead needs to choose the closest of the x player_controlled tanks as target.
We also need to change tankgame.py logic so it isnt hardcoded which tank is player_controlled, this need to be like:
if multiplayer is on we choose
    [0] if Host
    [1] if Client
else
    [0]

were
[0] is blue
[1] is red

For furture we with more players without ai, we just choose a random tank img for each player
